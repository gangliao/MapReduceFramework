### external directory (Do not make any changes in this directory)
When you provide a package(you can relate with grpc) to the outside world, you expose mainly two things: `libraries and header files`.

1. **external/include** - This directory consists of header files containing function declarations, that the user will make use of to run MapReduce.
  - `mapreduce.h` - This contains the interface that enables the user to use a MapReduce job.
  - `mr_task_factory.h` - This contains the interfaces through which the user can register their own mapper and reducer algorithm with MapReduce.

2. **external/lib** - This directory consists of libraries that has definitions of above functions, and so their implementations are hidden. **Note that these are autogenerated when you run `make` in your src directory**
  - `libmapreduce.a` - Library contain definitions for `mapreduce.h`.
  - `libmr_worker.a` - Library contain definitions for `mr_task_factory.h`.

### test directory
This gives you an insight of how a user will use your MapReduce package.

1. **`config.ini`** - Through this file the user gives input to your MapReduce framework as to how the user would like it to run.

2. **`user_tasks.cc`** - This is where the user has implemented his/her own algorithm for mapper and reducer. Then he/she registers it with the mr_task_factory, so that it can be picked up by your framework.

3. **`main.cc`** - This is just the entry point in the user's binary to run the MapReduce job.

### src directory (Do not make any changes in this directory)

1. **`masterworker.proto`** - containing the grpc protocol between master and worker.

2. **`file_shard.h`** - This file contains the data structure for how you would maintain info about the file splits, that master passes to workers for mapper task. Also it contains functions, that framework will call to generate file shards given the split size.

3. **`mapreduce_spec.h`** - This structure will be populated by the framework. There is a helper function which takes the config file name and populates this structure. Framework will also validate the structure(valid input file paths, apt amount of ip_addr_ports etc.). This structure is finally what is passed to the master, so think what all you would need in this.

4. **`master.h`** - This is where you have to think a lot about, what all master does in map reduce. And then construct the required data structure and book keeping. How it will communicate using grpc with the workers etc.

5. **`mr_tasks.h`** - This is where you implement the crux of how you handle a map/reduce task. It also includes emit function's implementation, which user's map/reduce function will use to write intermediate key/value papers.

6. **`worker.h`** - This is where you code how the workers will run map and reduce tasks on receiving a request from master, meanwhile simply waiting for a task the other times.
